# Perception Analytics Dashboard

The frontend component for the NodeLLM Brand Auditor. This is a high-performance React application built with **Vite** and **Framer Motion**, designed to provide high-fidelity visual diagnostics of AI model weights and market signals.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Node.js Architect Aesthetic**: Focuses on clarity, technical precision, and system-level transparency.
- **Bento-Grid Architecture**: Maximizes information density without compromising cognitive load.
- **Deterministic Visuals**: Every metric shown is a direct trace from the underlying NodeLLM protocol.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Real-time Neural Trace**: Visualizes the alignment between "Latent" (LLM) and "Live" (SERP) data.
- **Micro-animated Interaction**: Refined sequences during the multi-provider "crunching" phase.
- **Bespoke UI Tokens**: Uses curated Node.js Green accents and JetBrains Mono typography for a technical, developer-centric feel.

## 🛠 Local Development
```bash
# Install system packages
npm install

# Launch developer view
npm run dev
```

The application expects the Auditor Server to be running on `http://localhost:3001` by default.
