We can do it using multiplication algorithm. Let's explain step by step.\\n\\nOne common method is long multiplication. Write 123 and 456, multiply each digit.\\n\\nWe can break it down: 123 = 100 + 20 + 3, and 456 = 400 + 50 + 6. Then use distributive property.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the standard algorithm:\\n\\n   123\\n×  456\\n--------\\n\\nFirst, multiply 123 by 6 (the units digit of 456):\\n123 × 6 = 738. Write that down.\\n\\nThen multiply 123 by 5 (the tens digit of 456). But since it's actually 50, we get 123 × 50 = 6150. Write it shifted one place to the left.\\n\\nThen multiply 123 by 4 (the hundreds digit of 456). That's actually 400, so 123 × 400 = 49200. Write it shifted two places to the left.\\n\\nAdd them together.\\n\\nLet's compute step by step:\\n\\n123 × 6:\\n6 × 3 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\\n6 × 2 = 12, plus carry 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1.\\n6 × 1 = 6, plus carry 1 = 7, write 7.\\nSo 738.\\n\\n123 × 5 (but actually 50):\\n5 × 3 = 15, write 5 (in tens place), carry 1.\\n5 × 2 = 10, plus carry 1 = 11, write 1 (in hundreds place), carry 1.\\n5 × 1 = 5, plus carry 1 = 6, write 6.\\nSo we get 615, but since it's multiplied by 50, we write it as 6150 (or shift left one digit).\\n\\n123 × 4 (but actually 400):\\n4 × 3 = 12, write 2 (in hundreds place), carry 1.\\n4 × 2 = 8, plus carry 1 = 9, write 9.\\n4 × 1 = 4, write 4.\\nSo we get 492, but since it's multiplied by 400, we write it as 49200 (shift left two digits).\\n\\nNow add:\\n\\n    738\\n+  6150\\n+ 49200\\n--------\\nLet's align:\\n\\n    738\\n   6150\\n  49200\\n--------\\n\\nStart from right: 0+0+8 = 8.\\nTens: 0+5+3 = 8.\\nHundreds: 2+1+7 = 10, write 0, carry 1.\\nThousands: 9+6+ carry 1 = 16, write 6, carry 1.\\nTen thousands: 4 + carry 1 = 5.\\nSo total: 56088.\\n\\nThus, 123 × 456 = 56088.\\n\\nWe can double-check: 123 × 456 = ?\\nMaybe compute 123 × 400 = 49200, 123 × 56 = 123 × 50 = 6150, 123 × 6 = 738, sum 49200+6150=55350, plus 738 = 56088. Yes.\\n\\nSo the answer is 56088.\\n\\nNow, we need to provide explanation steps. The instruction says: \\\"Calculate 123 * 456 and explain the steps.\\\" So we should output a step-by-step explanation.\\n\\nI'll write a clear solution.\"},\"logprobs\":null,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":15,\"completion_tokens\":1451,\"total_tokens\":1466,\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"cached_tokens\":0},\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":763},\"prompt_cache_hit_tokens\":0,\"prompt_cache_miss_tokens\":15},\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache\"}"
